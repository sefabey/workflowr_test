This is a test website created using workflowr package. So far, it is working great.
The author of the package argues it is good for:

*  Easier to build and extend the website using the new tools in the [rmarkdown][] package and [latest RStudio release][rstudio]
*  Easier to deploy the website with Git and GitHub by only using one branch
